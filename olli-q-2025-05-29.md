# Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) Industry Overview

## Executive Summary

The Pharmacy Benefit Management industry represents one of the most concentrated and financially significant sectors in U.S. healthcare, with three major players controlling approximately 80% of the market. PBMs serve as intermediaries between health insurers, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, managing prescription drug benefits for over 270 million Americans. These companies have evolved from simple claims processors into vertically integrated healthcare conglomerates that own insurance plans, pharmacies, and specialty care facilities.

The industry generates substantial revenue through multiple streams including administrative fees, rebate retention, pharmacy spread pricing, and specialty pharmacy services. However, PBMs face increasing scrutiny from regulators, legislators, and healthcare stakeholders over pricing transparency, market concentration, and potential conflicts of interest inherent in their business model.
